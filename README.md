# Organizer App

This is a simple project with no purposes.
I aimed to understand paradigm and utilities of Next.js

Layouts are based on tailwindcss@4 and daisy@5.1

## Getting Started

To run the app :

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the organizer app.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
